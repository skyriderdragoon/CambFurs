This should be a comfortable environment for people to socialise and relax.", "Apple devices only display safe for work chat groups in Telegram. Ones flagged as not safe for work will not be displayed and as such would not allow a number of our group members to see the room."] },
    { key: 2, rule: "No discussion or images of illegal content or activities. This includes drugs.", reason: "It should be obvious that we don't condone illegal activities of any kind. Drugs have been particularly highlighted as discussions of the use of either illegal drugs, or the misuse of drugs, have a tendency to spiral out of control." },
    { key: 3, rule: "No “heavy” or “extreme” kinks in images or discussion. This includes vore and gore.", reason: "Discussion of “heavy” or “extreme” kinks can easily make those not interested in them uncomfortable. This can occur even if the kinks are not explicitly sexual in nature. We want this to be somewhere people can feel comfortable engaging in social chat." },

It's more complex than this, but if someone asks you to stop messaging them or that you're making them uncomfortable, just stop." },
    { key: 7, rule: "No politics in group chat.", reason: "Whilst politics is an important subject it's one where people often have strong opinions and tend to devolve very quickly into toxic and unpleasant chat. To avoid this we're not allowing discussion of politics. Encouragement of people to vote is fine, but not with discussion around specific parties or policies." },

If you disagree, take it to a direct message.", reason: "The admins are here to keep the chat safe and enjoyable for everyone. If they ask you to stop doing something, please do so. If you feel an admin is being unfair, contact another admin."},

We want to keep the group safe, friendly, and enjoyable for everyone (both online and at meets). Please do not take anything anyone says as an invitation to hit on them. Anyone reported as cruising (specifically looking for dates) will be asked to leave the group and may not be invited back." },

Generative AI which has been trained on users works without their consent, renumeration, or any respect for copyright is not something that we support or wish to allow."] },

We usually ask that all ads include prices and some examples of your work. Approval is at the discretion of the admin team.", subreasons:["Right now, the furry community is dealing with quite a few scammers selling either fake commissions or AI-generated work as their own.", "We ask everyone to chat with an admin first so we can check out their ad, making sure everything's clear and transparent, and that no one attending feels uncomfortable or misled."]}
